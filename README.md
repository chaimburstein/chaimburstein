- 👋 Hi, I’m @chaimburstein
- 👀 I’m interested in music, food and cars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit about coding so I can own my own data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that help people with very little tech knowledge get off of platforms/tech silos and own their own data. 
- 📫 How to reach me - my last name (Burstein), first initial (C) at gmail!
- Stuff I use... [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) , [Little Link](https://littlelink.io) , [1600pr](https://github.com/andersju/1600pr.sh) , [evenbettermotherfuckingwebsite](https://github.com/setetres/evenbettermotherfuckingwebsite)
